# 📝 Generative Story App

This is a simple Python application that uses an open-source GPT-2 model from Hugging Face to generate short stories based on a prompt you provide.

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 Uses a lightweight, open-source language model (GPT-2)
- 📜 Generates short stories from custom prompts
- 💡 Teaches the basics of text generation with Hugging Face Transformers
- 🐍 Built with Python using a fast, modern setup (`uv` + virtualenv)

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/generative-story-app.git
cd generative-story-app
```
````

2. **Set up environment with `uv`**

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/a # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the story generator script:

```bash
python generate_story.py
```

When prompted, enter any story idea (e.g., `A robot exploring Mars`) and watch GPT-2 complete it.

## 📘 Example Output

> **Prompt**: A robot exploring Mars
>
> **Generated Story**: A robot exploring Mars was the most advanced rover ever built. Equipped with AI and solar panels, it rolled across the rocky terrain, sending data back to Earth...

## ✍️ Motivation

This project is part of my learning journey into Generative AI. It's the foundation for a larger app that will explore creative writing, prompt engineering, and eventually Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows.
